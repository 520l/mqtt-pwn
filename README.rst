MQTT-PWN
========

MQTT is a machine-to-machine connectivity protocol designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe 
messaging transport and widely used by millions of IoT devices worldwide. MQTT-PWN intends to be a one-stop-shop 
for IoT Broker penetration-testing and security assessment operations, as it combines enumeration, 
supportive functions and exploitation modules while packing it all within command-line-interface 
with an easy-to-use and extensible shell-like environment.
